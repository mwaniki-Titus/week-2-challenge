Character Assembler
This project is a JavaScript function called assembleCharacters that fetches character data from a specified URL and dynamically creates elements based on the received data. It allows users to view character names, images, and vote for their favorite characters.

How It Works
When the assembleCharacters function is called, it sends a fetch request to the specified URL (http://localhost:3000/characters) to retrieve character data.
The fetched data, is parsed and processed.
For each character in the data, a paragraph (<p>) element is created and populated with the character's name.
The paragraph element is appended to a container element with the ID 'cont'.
An event listener is added to each paragraph element, so when it is clicked, the listener is triggered.
Upon clicking a character, an image element (<img>) with the character's image URL is created and appended to the paragraph element.
A vote count element (<a>) is also created and appended to the paragraph element, displaying the current number of votes for the character.
A reset button (<button>) is created and added to the paragraph element, allowing users to reset the vote count.
Clicking the reset button increments the vote count by 1 and updates the display accordingly.
The event listener for the paragraph element is set to trigger only once, ensuring that users can only vote once for each character.
The assembleCharacters function is called when the HTML content has finished loading.
